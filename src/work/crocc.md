# crocc

Crocc is a simple static-site generator based on Markdown. 
The main goal of Crocc is to offer simplicity, as opposed to other
static-site generation tools such as Hugo or Jekyll. 
Indeed, you only need Markdown to write content in a productive manner, 
and everything else is standard scripts (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).

In fact, Crocc is what I use to build this website.
