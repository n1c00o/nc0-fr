# Nova

Nova is a complete framework for building reliable and stable discord bots 
using a services based system to operate all the components needed to operate 
a discord such as the discord gateway, new discord webhooks for receiving
interactions. 

Using a traditional infrastructure (sharder / process), we can quickly reach 
bottlenecks when we scale to multiple thousands of shards. 
Nova is a way to avoid these problems by building a scale-first Discord 
framework that creates an environment that allow better testing, reliability 
and operations easier.
